# Space IF :space_invader:

**Space If** is a game made by me and my friend, Tod, for our end-of-course project of logic and algorithms fundamentals based on Space Invaders using python's library [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). Feel free to test it out!


##  How to play

Use controls WASD or arrow keys to beat the four levels (in reference to the four course periods) and each level is harder than the other.

## License
This project has the license to be radical.
